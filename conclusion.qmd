# Conclusion

Our analysis shows that the yield curve remains one of the most consistent early warning indicators of recessions. Inversions in spreads such as the 10Y–2Y or the 10Y–3M regularly occur months before economic downturns, and in many cases the signal appears well before unemployment begins to rise or inflation starts to fall. While false positives do occur, especially in periods of temporary financial stress, the yield curve still provides valuable information about market expectations and economic sentiment.

Looking across decades, however, we see that *recessions and unemployment no longer look the same*. In the mid-20th century, recessions caused sudden layoffs in manufacturing and construction, producing sharp spikes in unemployment. By contrast, more recent recessions, especially the 2001 and 2020 episodes show different patterns: slower climbs, service-sector contraction, and highly unequal effects across demographic groups. Women, younger workers, and Black and Hispanic workers often experience deeper and more prolonged unemployment during downturns, even when headline unemployment appears moderate. This emphasizes that the macroeconomic averages we usually monitor can hide important distributional realities.

The yield curve captures broad economic expectations, but pairing it with inflation dynamics and labor market detail reveals a more complete story. Recessions are not simply financial events or shifts in GDP—they are lived experiences that vary by time period, industry structure, and social group. Our findings suggest that while the yield curve tells us *when* trouble is coming, understanding *how* it will unfold requires looking beyond financial data and into the structure of the economy and the labor market itself.
