    "title": "Bends Before The Break: Understanding Recessions Through the Yield Curve",
    "section": "",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nRecessions are often described as sudden breaks in the economy, but in reality the warning signs usually appear long before the downturn begins. One of the clearest signals comes from the U.S. Treasury yield curve, which summarizes how interest rates differ across short and long-term maturities. When the curve “bends” or inverts, meaning short-term rates rise above long-term rates and it has historically been one of the strongest predictors of a coming recession.\nIn this project, we explore how the yield curve behaves across different maturities, how key spreads such as the 10-year minus 2-year or the 10-year minus 3-month evolve over time, and how these financial indicators line up with periods of economic stress. We extend this analysis by looking at inflation, unemployment, and demographic labor outcomes to understand how economic downturns unfold in the real world and not just in financial markets.\nOne important aspect we highlight is how the definition and experience of a recession have changed over time. Early recessions (1950s–1970s) were typically sharp industrial contractions with sudden drops in employment. Later recessions, particularly after the 1990s, were often slower-moving, service-sector driven, and more uneven in how they affected different demographic groups. Unemployment spikes became more gradual, recoveries slower, and the burden increasingly concentrated among younger workers, women, and minority groups. These structural changes in the labor market mean that the same financial signals, a flattening yield curve, rising volatility, can correspond to very different real-world outcomes depending on the era.\nBy combining yield curve dynamics with inflation trends and unemployment behavior across time, this project aims to show not only when recessions happen, but how they feel on the ground and who they impact most.",

The ones with higher missing percentages like TIPS breakeven rates (T10YIE, T5YIE, T5YIFR) and the Employment Cost Index are newer series that simply weren’t collected in earlier decades. This makes sense historically; TIPS didn’t exist until the late 1990s, and the ECI started in the 1980s. The oil price data (DCOILWTICO) also has gaps, likely due to market disruptions or data collection issues. For our analysis, we’ll focus on variables with good coverage, and when we need the newer series, we’ll work with the available time periods.\n\n\nCode\n# Display missing value table\nmissing_stats |&gt;\n  select(variable_clean, missing_count, missing_pct) |&gt;\n  filter(missing_pct &gt; 0) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(missing_pct)) |&gt;\n  head(15) |&gt;\n  knitr::kable(\n    col.names = c(\"Variable\", \"Missing Count\", \"Missing %\"),\n    digits = 1,\n    caption = \"Top 15 Variables by Missing Data Percentage\"\n  )\n\n\n\nTop 15 Variables by Missing Data Percentage\n\n\nVariable\nMissing Count\nMissing %\n\n\n\n\n10Y Breakeven\n588\n68.1\n\n\n5Y Forward\n588\n68.1\n\n\n5Y Breakeven\n588\n68.1\n\n\nEmployment Cost Index\n564\n65.4\n\n\nWTI Oil\n384\n44.5\n\n\n3-Month Treasury\n332\n38.5\n\n\nMichigan Survey\n288\n33.4\n\n\n30-Year Treasury\n277\n32.1\n\n\n2-Year Treasury\n269\n31.2\n\n\nUnemp: Hispanic\n230\n26.7\n\n\nUnemp: Black\n216\n25.0\n\n\n7-Year Treasury\n186\n21.6\n\n\nCPI Food\n156\n18.1\n\n\n10-Year Treasury\n96\n11.1\n\n\n1-Year Treasury\n96\n11.1",

The 10-year Treasury yield is pretty spread out, ranging from near zero (recent years) to over 15% (early 1980s), with most values clustering around 4-6%. Unemployment shows a right-skewed distribution most of the time it’s below 6%, but we do see those painful spikes during recessions. The inflation distribution is interesting too; it’s centered around 2-3% but has a long tail on the right from those high-inflation periods in the 1970s and early 1980s. This tells us our dataset captures both normal times and extreme events, which is exactly what we need.\n\n\n2.3.4 Correlation Matrix of Key Variables\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate correlations for key variables\ncor_vars &lt;- c(\"dgs10\", \"dgs2\", \"dgs3mo\", \"unrate\", \"cpiaucsl\", \"cpilfesl\")\ncor_data &lt;- master |&gt;\n  select(all_of(cor_vars)) |&gt;\n  cor(use = \"pairwise.complete.obs\")\n\n# Create full names for labels\nfull_names &lt;- c(\n  \"dgs10\" = \"10-Year Treasury Yield\",\n  \"dgs2\" = \"2-Year Treasury Yield\",\n  \"dgs3mo\" = \"3-Month Treasury Yield\",\n  \"unrate\" = \"Unemployment Rate\",\n  \"cpiaucsl\" = \"CPI Headline\",\n  \"cpilfesl\" = \"CPI Core\"\n)\n\n# Rename rows and columns\nrownames(cor_data) &lt;- full_names[rownames(cor_data)]\ncolnames(cor_data) &lt;- full_names[colnames(cor_data)]\n\n# Create correlation plot with same orientation on both axes\ncorrplot(\n  cor_data,\n  method = \"color\",\n  type = \"full\",\n  order = \"hclust\",\n  tl.cex = 0.8,\n  tl.col = \"black\",\n  tl.srt = 45,  # Rotate labels 45 degrees\n  addCoef.col = \"black\",\n  number.cex = 0.7,\n  diag = TRUE\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInference: The correlation matrix reveals some expected relationships. Treasury yields at different maturities are highly correlated (0.8-0.9), which makes sense as they’re all responding to similar economic forces. CPI headline and core are very closely related (0.99), as expected. Interestingly, yields and inflation show moderate positive correlation, which reinforces the idea that higher inflation expectations push bond yields up. What’s also interesting is that we don’t see strong negative correlations here unemployment doesn’t correlate strongly with yields or inflation in this simple view, but that’s probably because the relationship is more complex and time-varying. The Phillips curve relationship (negative correlation between unemployment and inflation) might be masked by the long time period or might only appear during specific economic regimes. The clustering in the plot groups similar variables together, which helps us understand the structure of our data.",

It captures the instantaneous structure of interest rates at a moment in time. The plotting style we used for this is a simple line plot with plots, whilst also making sure to use viridis for colourblind friendly features. The x-axis is for the maturity and the y-axis is the yield in percentage terms. Overall, the inference we drew from this is that the curve conveys the market’s expectations, so if the curve is in an upward-sloping direction then it shows normal conditions and also the expectations of growth and inflation. This also sets a base of how the curve would change and would imply macroeconomic turning points",

The plot includes dashed red lines marking thresholds (5% inflation, 6% unemployment) to identify stagflation conditions. Circles represent non-recession periods, while triangles mark recessions.\nInference: This scatter plot maps inflation against unemployment, with recession periods marked as triangles. Most points fall in the bottom-right quadrant (high unemployment, low inflation)—the normal trade-off. The top-right quadrant (stagflation) shows both high simultaneously, especially in the 1970s-80s. The dashed lines mark our thresholds (5% inflation, 6% unemployment). Stagflation periods explain why the Fed struggled then: raising rates worsened unemployment, while cutting rates worsened inflation.\n\n\n3.1.2 Dynamic Term-Structure Evolution (Heatmap)\n\n\nCode\n# Prepare yield curve data for heatmap\n# Use key maturities: 3M, 2Y, 5Y, 10Y, 30Y\ndf_yield_heatmap &lt;- master |&gt;\n  select(date, dgs3mo, dgs2, dgs5, dgs10, dgs30) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = -date,\n    names_to = \"maturity\",\n    values_to = \"yield\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(yield)) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    maturity = factor(\n      maturity,\n      levels = c(\"dgs3mo\", \"dgs2\", \"dgs5\", \"dgs10\", \"dgs30\"),\n      labels = c(\"3M\", \"2Y\", \"5Y\", \"10Y\", \"30Y\")\n    ),\n    year = year(date),\n    month = month(date)\n  ) |&gt;\n  # Aggregate to quarterly for smoother visualization\n  mutate(\n    quarter = paste0(year, \"-Q\", ceiling(month / 3))\n  ) |&gt;\n  group_by(quarter, maturity) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    yield = mean(yield, na.rm = TRUE),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  # Convert quarter to date for ordering\n  mutate(\n    year_q = as.numeric(substr(quarter, 1, 4)) + (as.numeric(substr(quarter, 6, 6)) - 1) / 4\n  )\n\n\nWarning: There was 1 warning in `mutate()`.\nℹ In argument: `year_q = +...`.\nCaused by warning:\n!

Each row represents a quarter, and reading across shows the curve shape at that time. The plot uses a sequential color palette to show yield levels across maturities (3M to 30Y) from top to bottom chronologically.\nInference: This heatmap shows yield curve evolution over time, with warmer colors indicating higher yields. Each row represents a quarter; reading across shows the curve shape. Normal upward-sloping curves get warmer moving right (longer maturities). Inversions appear as horizontal bands where shorter maturities (left) are warmer than longer ones (right), and these historically precede recessions. Major inversions occurred in the early 1980s, before 2008, and recently. The overall color shift shows yields have generally fallen since the 1980s.",

Each group is represented by a different colored line, making it easy to compare disparities. The plot reveals how different groups experience the labor market differently.\nInference: This multi-line plot reveals persistent labor market disparities. Black and Hispanic workers consistently face much higher unemployment than White workers—often double or more. These gaps exist even in good times, pointing to structural issues beyond economic cycles. Gender patterns have shifted: women had higher unemployment in the 1950s-60s, but that reversed in recent decades. During recessions, all groups suffer, but racial gaps widen, making things worse for already disadvantaged workers.\n\n\n3.2.2 Men vs Women Unemployment During Recessions\n\n\nCode\n# Prepare men vs women data with recession indicator\ndf_gender_recession &lt;- master |&gt;\n  select(date, lns14000001, lns14000002, usrec) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(lns14000001), !is.na(lns14000002)) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(lns14000001, lns14000002),\n    names_to = \"gender\",\n    values_to = \"unemployment_rate\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    gender = factor(\n      gender,\n      levels = c(\"lns14000001\", \"lns14000002\"),\n      labels = c(\"Men\", \"Women\")\n    ),\n    is_recession = factor(usrec, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c(\"Expansion\", \"Recession\"))\n  )\n\n# Identify recession periods for shading\nrecessions_gender &lt;- df_gender_recession |&gt;\n  filter(usrec == 1) |&gt;\n  distinct(date) |&gt;\n  arrange(date) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    gap = as.numeric(date - lag(date)),\n    grp = cumsum(is.na(gap) | gap &gt; 40)\n  ) |&gt;\n  group_by(grp) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    start = min(date),\n    end = max(date),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  )\n\nggplot() +\n  # Recession shading\n  geom_rect(\n    data = recessions_gender,\n    aes(xmin = start, xmax = end, ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf),\n    inherit.aes = FALSE,\n    fill = \"grey80\",\n    alpha = 0.3\n  ) +\n  # Gender lines\n  geom_line(\n    data = df_gender_recession,\n    aes(x = date, y = unemployment_rate, colour = gender),\n    linewidth = 0.8\n  ) +\n  scale_colour_manual(name = \"Gender\", values = c(\"darkblue\", \"darkred\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Men vs Women Unemployment During Recessions\",\n    subtitle = \"Comparison of unemployment rates by gender, with recession periods shaded\",\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Unemployment Rate (%)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 13) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot compares men’s and women’s unemployment rates over time, with recession periods shaded gray. It uses two colored lines (dark blue for men, dark red for women) to show how each gender experiences economic cycles differently. The gray rectangles highlight recession periods to see how gender patterns change during downturns.\nInference: This plot compares men’s and women’s unemployment over time, with recession periods shaded. In the 1970s-80s, men’s unemployment spiked higher during recessions because they dominated manufacturing and construction. Women’s unemployment was more stable, partly due to concentration in services and education. The 2008 recession changed this—women’s unemployment caught up and even exceeded men’s, reflecting how the Great Recession hit services and government jobs. Recent patterns have converged as the economy became more balanced.\n\n\n3.2.3 Younger vs Older Workers’ Unemployment Patterns\n\n\nCode\n# Prepare age-based unemployment data\ndf_age_unemp &lt;- master |&gt;\n  select(\n    date,\n    lns14000012,      # 16-19 years\n    lns14000089,      # 20-24 years\n    lns14000025,      # 25-54 years (prime age)\n    lns14000036       # 55+ years\n  ) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = -date,\n    names_to = \"age_group\",\n    values_to = \"unemployment_rate\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(unemployment_rate)) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    age_group = factor(\n      age_group,\n      levels = c(\"lns14000012\", \"lns14000089\", \"lns14000025\", \"lns14000036\"),\n      labels = c(\"16-19 years\", \"20-24 years\", \"25-54 years (Prime)\", \"55+ years\")\n    )\n  )\n\nggplot(df_age_unemp, aes(x = date, y = unemployment_rate, colour = age_group)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 0.7, alpha = 0.8) +\n  scale_colour_brewer(name = \"Age Group\", palette = \"Set1\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Unemployment Patterns by Age Group\",\n    subtitle = \"Unemployment rates for different age cohorts over time\",\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Unemployment Rate (%)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 13) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis multi-line plot shows unemployment rates across different age groups (16-19, 20-24, 25-54, 55+) over time. Each age group is represented by a different colored line, revealing how age affects labor market outcomes. The plot highlights that younger workers consistently face much higher unemployment rates.\nInference: This multi-line plot shows unemployment by age group. Teenagers (16-19) and young adults (20-24) consistently have much higher unemployment—often 15-20% even in good times, partly due to part-time work and being laid off first. Prime-age workers (25-54) fare best, usually staying under 5% in normal times. Older workers (55+) are in the middle but face longer job searches when unemployed. During recessions, the young get hit hardest—unemployment can spike to 25% or more while prime-age workers might only reach 8-10%.\n\n\n3.2.4 Real Wage Inequality (High vs Low Income)\n\n\nCode\n# Use Employment Cost Index as proxy for wages\n# Calculate real wage growth by deflating with CPI\ndf_wages &lt;- master |&gt;\n  arrange(date) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    # Employment Cost Index (already an index)\n    eci = eciallciv,\n    # Calculate real ECI by deflating with CPI\n    # Use base period CPI (e.g., 1982-84 = 100) as reference\n    cpi_index = cpiaucsl,\n    # Real wage index = ECI / CPI * 100 (normalize to base period)\n    real_wage_index = (eci / cpi_index) * 100\n  ) |&gt;\n  select(date, eci, real_wage_index) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(eci), !is.na(real_wage_index)) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    # Calculate year-over-year growth rates\n    nominal_wage_growth = (eci / lag(eci, 12) - 1) * 100,\n    real_wage_growth = (real_wage_index / lag(real_wage_index, 12) - 1) * 100\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(nominal_wage_growth), !is.na(real_wage_growth))\n\n# Note: ECI data is limited, so we show what's available\n# For a more complete analysis, we'd need wage data by income quintile\ndf_wage_long &lt;- df_wages |&gt;\n  select(date, nominal_wage_growth, real_wage_growth) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = -date,\n    names_to = \"wage_type\",\n    values_to = \"growth_rate\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    wage_type = factor(\n      wage_type,\n      levels = c(\"nominal_wage_growth\", \"real_wage_growth\"),\n      labels = c(\"Nominal Wage Growth\", \"Real Wage Growth (CPI-adjusted)\")\n    )\n  )\n\nggplot(df_wage_long, aes(x = date, y = growth_rate, colour = wage_type)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 0.8) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, colour = \"black\", linewidth = 0.4, linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  scale_colour_manual(name = \"Wage Measure\", values = c(\"darkblue\", \"darkgreen\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Real Wage Growth Over Time\",\n    subtitle = \"Nominal vs inflation-adjusted wage growth using Employment Cost Index\",\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Year-over-Year Growth (%)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 13) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot compares nominal wage growth (blue) with real wage growth (green, CPI-adjusted) over time. It uses two colored lines with a dashed zero line as reference. The gap between the lines shows how much inflation erodes purchasing power. This helps understand the difference between what paychecks say and what they actually buy.\nInference: This plot compares nominal wage growth (blue) with real wage growth (green, CPI-adjusted). When the green line goes negative, workers get a real pay cut even if nominal wages rise. This happened during high-inflation periods like the 1970s and recently. The gap between the lines represents the inflation tax—how much inflation erodes purchasing power. This is aggregate data, so it doesn’t show how low-wage workers often get hit harder, but it reveals the overall squeeze on workers.",

    "text": "Our analysis shows that the yield curve remains one of the most consistent early warning indicators of recessions. Inversions in spreads such as the 10Y–2Y or the 10Y–3M regularly occur months before economic downturns, and in many cases the signal appears well before unemployment begins to rise or inflation starts to fall. While false positives do occur, especially in periods of temporary financial stress, the yield curve still provides valuable information about market expectations and economic sentiment.\nLooking across decades, however, we see that recessions and unemployment no longer look the same. In the mid-20th century, recessions caused sudden layoffs in manufacturing and construction, producing sharp spikes in unemployment. By contrast, more recent recessions, especially the 2001 and 2020 episodes show different patterns: slower climbs, service-sector contraction, and highly unequal effects across demographic groups. Women, younger workers, and Black and Hispanic workers often experience deeper and more prolonged unemployment during downturns, even when headline unemployment appears moderate. This emphasizes that the macroeconomic averages we usually monitor can hide important distributional realities.\nThe yield curve captures broad economic expectations, but pairing it with inflation dynamics and labor market detail reveals a more complete story. Recessions are not simply financial events or shifts in GDP—they are lived experiences that vary by time period, industry structure, and social group. Our findings suggest that while the yield curve tells us when trouble is coming, understanding how it will unfold requires looking beyond financial data and into the structure of the economy and the labor market itself.",
