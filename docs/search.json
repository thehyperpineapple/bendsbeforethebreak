    "section": "",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nRecessions are often described as sudden breaks in the economy, but in reality the warning signs usually appear long before the downturn begins. One of the clearest signals comes from the U.S. Treasury yield curve, which summarizes how interest rates differ across short and long-term maturities. When the curve “bends” or inverts—meaning short-term rates rise above long-term rates—it has historically been one of the strongest predictors of a coming recession.",

    "text": "1.1 Research Questions\nThis project addresses three key questions:\n\nHow reliable are yield curve inversions as recession predictors?\nWe examine multiple spreads (10Y-2Y, 10Y-3M, 5Y-2Y) to determine which provide the earliest and most accurate signals, and how often false positives occur.\nHow do inflation dynamics interact with unemployment and recessions?\nWe explore whether the traditional Phillips curve relationship holds, when it breaks down (as during stagflation), and how supply-driven versus demand-driven inflation affects bond markets differently.\nHow have recessions changed over time, and who bears the burden?\nWe investigate whether the experience of economic downturns has shifted from sharp industrial contractions to slower service-sector declines, and how unemployment patterns vary across demographic groups (gender, race, age).",

We extend this analysis by looking at inflation, unemployment, and demographic labor outcomes to understand how economic downturns unfold in the real world and not just in financial markets.",

This makes sense historically; TIPS didn’t exist until the late 1990s, and the ECI started in the 1980s. The oil price data (DCOILWTICO) also has gaps, likely due to market disruptions or data collection issues. For our analysis, we’ll focus on variables with good coverage, and when we need the newer series, we’ll work with the available time periods.",

The 10-year Treasury yield is pretty spread out, ranging from near zero (recent years) to over 15% (early 1980s), with most values clustering around 4-6%. Unemployment shows a right-skewed distribution most of the time it’s below 6%, but we do see those painful spikes during recessions. The inflation distribution is interesting too; it’s centered around 2-3% but has a long tail on the right from those high-inflation periods in the 1970s and early 1980s. This tells us our dataset captures both normal times and extreme events, which is exactly what we need.\n\n\n2.3.4 Correlation Matrix of Key Variables\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate correlations for key variables\ncor_vars &lt;- c(\"dgs10\", \"dgs2\", \"dgs3mo\", \"unrate\", \"cpiaucsl\", \"cpilfesl\")\ncor_data &lt;- master |&gt;\n  select(all_of(cor_vars)) |&gt;\n  cor(use = \"pairwise.complete.obs\")\n\n# Create full names for labels\nfull_names &lt;- c(\n  \"dgs10\" = \"10-Year Treasury Yield\",\n  \"dgs2\" = \"2-Year Treasury Yield\",\n  \"dgs3mo\" = \"3-Month Treasury Yield\",\n  \"unrate\" = \"Unemployment Rate\",\n  \"cpiaucsl\" = \"CPI Headline\",\n  \"cpilfesl\" = \"CPI Core\"\n)\n\n# Rename rows and columns\nrownames(cor_data) &lt;- full_names[rownames(cor_data)]\ncolnames(cor_data) &lt;- full_names[colnames(cor_data)]\n\n# Create correlation plot with same orientation on both axes\ncorrplot(\n  cor_data,\n  method = \"color\",\n  type = \"full\",\n  order = \"hclust\",\n  tl.cex = 0.8,\n  tl.col = \"black\",\n  tl.srt = 45,  # Rotate labels 45 degrees\n  addCoef.col = \"black\",\n  number.cex = 0.7,\n  diag = TRUE\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe correlation matrix reveals some expected relationships. Treasury yields at different maturities are highly correlated (0.8-0.9), which makes sense as they’re all responding to similar economic forces. CPI headline and core are very closely related (0.99), as expected. Interestingly, yields and inflation show moderate positive correlation, which could reinforce the idea that higher inflation expectations push bond yields up. What’s also interesting is that we don’t see strong negative correlations here unemployment doesn’t correlate strongly with yields or inflation in this simple view, but that’s probably because the relationship is more complex and time-varying. The Phillips curve relationship (negative correlation between unemployment and inflation) might be masked by the long time period or might only appear during specific economic regimes. The clustering in the plot groups similar variables together, which helps us understand the structure of our data.",

You can see that short-term rates are much more sensitive to Fed policy, often spiking during tightening cycles whie long-term rates are more stable, driven by future growth expectations. When the short-term lines cross above the long-term ones, it flags a curve inversion which is a classic recession signal. The bond yields gradually fell down primarily because of drops in market interest rates and increased demand for safe assets during economic uncertainity. US bond yields rose after 2020 primarily because of surging inflation, which peaked in 2022. To fight this, the Federal Reserve aggressively hiked interest rates. Yields were further pushed up by a strong economic recovery and increased government borrowing, both of which led investors to demand higher returns.",

We included a zero line to easily spot inversions and shaded the recession periods in grey. We can observe that inversions are a flashing warning, having preceded every recession in the last half-century. It’s not always immediate (there is usually a 6–15 month lag) but the predictive power of the curve is undeniable.\n\n\n3.3.2 U.S. Yield Curve Spreads Over Time\n\n\nCode\n# 1.

It shows which one tends to invert first and which is the strongest signal historically. It is a multi line time series plot and the zero line is for the conversion threshold. The time frequency of 10Y-3M is the most reliable and earliest predictor of recessions, the 10Y-2Y also predicts recessions but often inverts later and 5Y-2Y is prone to false positives, and when all spreads invert the recession risk becomes extremely high. This plot also is a signal as to why analysts look at multiple spreads and not just one\n\n\n3.3.3 Average Lead Time of Spread Inversions Before U.S. Recessions\n\n\nCode\n# -----------------------------------------\n# 1.

Here, we incurred that the 10Y-3M has the longest average lead time and is the most useful early warning. The 10Y-2Y time period has moderate predictive power, 5Y-2Y has the shortest lead time and more noise, on an average the yield curve gives 6-15 months of warning before recessions. We can conclude that the spreads are not equal and some may outperform others dramatically.\n\n\n3.3.4 True Recession Signals vs False Positives\n\n\nCode\n# 1.

Here the shaded rectangles are for the inversion windows, the rectangles are colour coded by signal type, we also placed a zero line anchor. Here , we incurred that a handful of false positives exist like the 1998-debt crisis, true positives dominate the historical record. False positives tend to occur during periods of temporary financial stress but not real downturns as such. This eventually strengthens the credibility of inversion as a recession predictor while acknowledging limitations. Overall, the plot does add nuance where in the signal seems to be good but not perfect.\n\n\n3.3.5 Rolling 12-Month Volatility of Treasury Yields\n\n\nCode\n# Ensure sorted by date\ndf_vol &lt;- master |&gt;\n  arrange(date) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    vol_10y = rollapply(dgs10, width = 12, FUN = sd, fill = NA, align = \"right\"),\n    vol_2y  = rollapply(dgs2,  width = 12, FUN = sd, fill = NA, align = \"right\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  select(date, vol_10y, vol_2y) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = -date,\n    names_to = \"maturity\",\n    values_to = \"volatility\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    maturity = factor(\n      maturity,\n      levels = c(\"vol_10y\", \"vol_2y\"),\n      labels = c(\"10-Year\", \"2-Year\")\n    )\n  )\n\nggplot(df_vol, aes(x = date, y = volatility, colour = maturity)) +\n  geom_rect(\n    data = recessions,\n    aes(xmin = start, xmax = end, ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf),\n    inherit.aes = FALSE,\n    fill = \"grey80\",\n    alpha = 0.4\n  ) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 0.7) +\n  scale_colour_brewer(name = \"Maturity\", palette = \"Set1\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Rolling 12-Month Volatility of Treasury Yields\",\n    subtitle = \"Standard deviation of monthly yields for 10Y and 2Y Treasuries\",\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Volatility (std. dev. of yield, in percentage points)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 13) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can observe that volatility spikes before and during recessions (grey shaded area), reflecting uncertainty. The 2-year yield is more volatile, as it is closer to Fed policy actions, and volatility dropped significantly during the post-2008 low-rate regime. Rising volatility precedes most recession periods, providing an alternative risk measure. Overall it reflects the idea that markets become unstable as downturns approach.\n\n\n3.3.6 Inflation Over Time: Headline vs Core CPI\n\n\nCode\n# 1.

Combine vertically\np_inf / p_spread +\n  plot_layout(heights = c(2, 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is two-panel visualization, the top headline is CPI vs Core CPI, and the bottom shows the 10Y-2Y spread. This allows for comparison of inflation regimes with yield curve behaviour. Here, we stacked a layout using patchwork, we also wanted to make sure that the spread uses a single viridis colour and zero line. This plot displays that high inflation regimes often precede flattening or inversion of the yield curve which corresponds to tightening cycles. The difference between headline and core CPI tells us whether inflation is supply driven or demand driven. The periods of high inflation like the 70s-80s shows us deep inversions. The inflation spikes in 2021-22 again corresponds to major tightening and curve flattening. This plot connects macro inflation regimes directly to market expectations embedded in the yield curve.",

Most recessions show the classic trade-off: unemployment spikes while inflation drops. But the 1970s-80s broke this pattern. Both inflation and unemployment rate were high simultaneously (stagflation), which is why the Phillips curve relationship (shows an inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation in the short run) failed then. The Fed faced impossible choices: fighting inflation worsened unemployment, and vice versa. Recent decades show a less clear relationship, suggesting the economy’s dynamics have shifted.\n\n\n3.4.2 CPI vs Core CPI vs PCE Over Time\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate YoY inflation rates for all three measures\ndf_inflation_measures &lt;- master |&gt;\n  arrange(date) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    cpi_yoy = (cpiaucsl / lag(cpiaucsl, 12) - 1) * 100,\n    cpi_core_yoy = (cpilfesl / lag(cpilfesl, 12) - 1) * 100,\n    pce_yoy = (pcepi / lag(pcepi, 12) - 1) * 100\n  ) |&gt;\n  select(date, cpi_yoy, cpi_core_yoy, pce_yoy) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = -date,\n    names_to = \"measure\",\n    values_to = \"inflation_rate\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(inflation_rate)) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    measure = factor(\n      measure,\n      levels = c(\"cpi_yoy\", \"cpi_core_yoy\", \"pce_yoy\"),\n      labels = c(\"CPI (Headline)\", \"CPI (Core)\", \"PCE (Headline)\")\n    )\n  )\n\nggplot(df_inflation_measures, aes(x = date, y = inflation_rate, colour = measure)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 0.8) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, colour = \"black\", linewidth = 0.3, linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  scale_colour_brewer(name = \"Inflation Measure\", palette = \"Set1\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"CPI vs Core CPI vs PCE Inflation Over Time\",\n    subtitle = \"Year-over-year inflation rates for different price indices\",\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Year-over-Year Inflation (%)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 13) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis multi-line plot compares three inflation measures over time. Core Consumer price index (CPI) is smoother since it excludes volatile food and energy. When headline CPI spikes above core, it’s usually oil shocks which visible in the 1970s and in recent times. Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) runs slightly lower than CPI, which is why the Fed prefers it. The gaps between headline and core reveal when inflation comes from commodity price swings versus broader economic forces.\n\n\n3.4.3 Supply-Driven vs Demand-Driven Inflation vs Yields\n\n\nCode\n# Create proxies for supply-driven and demand-driven inflation\n# Supply-driven: Energy prices (PPI Energy, CPI Energy)\n# Demand-driven: Core inflation (excludes energy/food)\ndf_supply_demand &lt;- master |&gt;\n  arrange(date) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    # Supply-driven: Energy component YoY\n    supply_inflation = (cpiengsl / lag(cpiengsl, 12) - 1) * 100,\n    # Demand-driven: Core CPI YoY (excludes energy/food)\n    demand_inflation = (cpilfesl / lag(cpilfesl, 12) - 1) * 100,\n    # Use 10-year yield as representative\n    yield_10y = dgs10\n  ) |&gt;\n  select(date, supply_inflation, demand_inflation, yield_10y) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(supply_inflation), !is.na(demand_inflation), !is.na(yield_10y))\n\n# Create long format for inflation measures\ndf_inf_long &lt;- df_supply_demand |&gt;\n  select(date, supply_inflation, demand_inflation) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = -date,\n    names_to = \"inflation_type\",\n    values_to = \"inflation_rate\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    inflation_type = factor(\n      inflation_type,\n      levels = c(\"supply_inflation\", \"demand_inflation\"),\n      labels = c(\"Supply-Driven (Energy)\", \"Demand-Driven (Core)\")\n    )\n  )\n\n# Plot with dual y-axes using secondary axis\np1 &lt;- ggplot(df_inf_long, aes(x = date, y = inflation_rate, colour = inflation_type)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 0.8) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, colour = \"black\", linewidth = 0.3, linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  scale_colour_manual(name = \"Inflation Type\", values = c(\"darkorange\", \"darkgreen\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Supply-Driven vs Demand-Driven Inflation vs Yields\",\n    subtitle = \"Energy-based (supply) vs Core (demand) inflation with 10-Year Treasury yield\",\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Year-over-Year Inflation (%)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 13) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(df_supply_demand, aes(x = date, y = yield_10y)) +\n  geom_line(colour = \"purple\", linewidth = 0.8) +\n  labs(\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"10-Year Yield (%)\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_percent(scale = 0.01)) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 13) +\n  theme(\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\", colour = NA)\n  )\n\n# Combine plots\np1 / p2 +\n  plot_layout(heights = c(2, 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis two-panel plot separates supply-driven inflation (through energy prices) from demand-driven (core inflation), with the 10-year yield below. Supply shocks are volatile, meaning they spike during oil crises then crash. Demand-driven inflation is smoother and reflects broader economic conditions. The 10-year yield responds to both but seems more sensitive to persistent demand-driven inflation. Supply shocks push yields up temporarily, but demand-driven inflation has staying power. This matters because the Fed can’t control supply shocks but can influence demand through policy.",

This scatter plot maps inflation against unemployment, with recession periods marked as triangles. Most points fall in the bottom-right quadrant (high unemployment, low inflation)—the normal trade-off. The top-right quadrant (stagflation) shows both high simultaneously, especially in the 1970s-80s. The dashed lines mark our thresholds (5% inflation, 6% unemployment). These stagflation periods explain why the Fed struggled then as raising rates worsened unemployment, while cutting rates worsened inflation.\n\n\n3.5.2 Dynamic Term-Structure Evolution (Heatmap)\n\n\nCode\n# Prepare yield curve data for heatmap\n# Use key maturities: 3M, 2Y, 5Y, 10Y, 30Y\ndf_yield_heatmap &lt;- master |&gt;\n  select(date, dgs3mo, dgs2, dgs5, dgs10, dgs30) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = -date,\n    names_to = \"maturity\",\n    values_to = \"yield\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(yield)) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    maturity = factor(\n      maturity,\n      levels = c(\"dgs3mo\", \"dgs2\", \"dgs5\", \"dgs10\", \"dgs30\"),\n      labels = c(\"3M\", \"2Y\", \"5Y\", \"10Y\", \"30Y\")\n    ),\n    year = year(date),\n    month = month(date)\n  ) |&gt;\n  # Aggregate to quarterly for smoother visualization\n  mutate(\n    quarter = paste0(year, \"-Q\", ceiling(month / 3))\n  ) |&gt;\n  group_by(quarter, maturity) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    yield = mean(yield, na.rm = TRUE),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  # Convert quarter to date for ordering\n  mutate(\n    year_q = as.numeric(substr(quarter, 1, 4)) + (as.numeric(substr(quarter, 6, 6)) - 1) / 4\n  )\n\n# Create heatmap\nggplot(df_yield_heatmap, aes(x = maturity, y = reorder(quarter, year_q), fill = yield)) +\n  geom_tile() +\n  scale_fill_distiller(name = \"Yield (%)\", palette = \"YlOrRd\", direction = 1, labels = label_percent(scale = 0.01)) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Dynamic Term-Structure Evolution: Yield Curve Heatmap\",\n    subtitle = \"Quarterly average yields across maturities, showing yield curve shape evolution over time\",\n    x = \"Maturity\",\n    y = \"Quarter\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 6),\n    panel.grid = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = \"right\"\n  ) +\n  # Show every 5th quarter label to reduce clutter\n  scale_y_discrete(breaks = function(x) x[seq(1, length(x), by = 10)])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis heatmap shows yield curve evolution over time, with warmer colors indicating higher yields.

Major inversions occurred in the early 1980s, before 2008, and recently. The overall color shift shows yields have generally fallen since the 1980s.",

Black and Hispanic workers consistently face much higher unemployment than White workers (often double or more). These gaps exist even in good times, pointing to structural issues beyond economic cycles. Additionaly, the spike of unemployment in 2020 was due to the COVID-19 pandemic era. To conclude, during recessions all groups suffer, but racial gaps widen, making things worse for already disadvantaged workers.\n\n\n3.6.2 Men vs Women Unemployment During Recessions\n\n\nCode\n# Prepare men vs women data with recession indicator\ndf_gender_recession &lt;- master |&gt;\n  select(date, lns14000001, lns14000002, usrec) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(lns14000001), !is.na(lns14000002)) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(lns14000001, lns14000002),\n    names_to = \"gender\",\n    values_to = \"unemployment_rate\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    gender = factor(\n      gender,\n      levels = c(\"lns14000001\", \"lns14000002\"),\n      labels = c(\"Men\", \"Women\")\n    ),\n    is_recession = factor(usrec, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c(\"Expansion\", \"Recession\"))\n  )\n\n# Identify recession periods for shading\nrecessions_gender &lt;- df_gender_recession |&gt;\n  filter(usrec == 1) |&gt;\n  distinct(date) |&gt;\n  arrange(date) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    gap = as.numeric(date - lag(date)),\n    grp = cumsum(is.na(gap) | gap &gt; 40)\n  ) |&gt;\n  group_by(grp) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    start = min(date),\n    end = max(date),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  )\n\nggplot() +\n  # Recession shading\n  geom_rect(\n    data = recessions_gender,\n    aes(xmin = start, xmax = end, ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf),\n    inherit.aes = FALSE,\n    fill = \"grey80\",\n    alpha = 0.3\n  ) +\n  # Gender lines\n  geom_line(\n    data = df_gender_recession,\n    aes(x = date, y = unemployment_rate, colour = gender),\n    linewidth = 0.8\n  ) +\n  scale_colour_manual(name = \"Gender\", values = c(\"darkblue\", \"darkred\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Men vs Women Unemployment During Recessions\",\n    subtitle = \"Comparison of unemployment rates by gender, with recession periods shaded\",\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Unemployment Rate (%)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 13) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the 1970s-80s, men’s unemployment spiked higher during recessions because they dominated manufacturing and construction. Women’s unemployment was more stable, partly due to concentration in services and education. The 2008 recession changed this. Women’s unemployment caught up and even exceeded men’s, reflecting how the Great Recession hit services and government jobs. Recent patterns have converged as the economy became more balanced. It can also be observed that the pandemic affected both women and men equally in terms of unemployment\n\n\n3.6.3 Younger vs Older Workers’ Unemployment Patterns During Recessions\n\n\nCode\n# Prepare age-based unemployment data\ndf_age_unemp &lt;- master |&gt;\n  select(\n    date,\n    lns14000012,      # 16-19 years\n    lns14000089,      # 20-24 years\n    lns14000025,      # 25-54 years (prime age)\n    lns14000036       # 55+ years\n  ) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = -date,\n    names_to = \"age_group\",\n    values_to = \"unemployment_rate\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(unemployment_rate)) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    age_group = factor(\n      age_group,\n      levels = c(\"lns14000012\", \"lns14000089\", \"lns14000025\", \"lns14000036\"),\n      labels = c(\"16-19 years\", \"20-24 years\", \"25-54 years (Prime)\", \"55+ years\")\n    )\n  )\n\nggplot(df_age_unemp, aes(x = date, y = unemployment_rate, colour = age_group)) +\n  # Recession shading\n  geom_rect(\n    data = recessions_phillips,\n    aes(xmin = start, xmax = end, ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf),\n    inherit.aes = FALSE,\n    fill = \"grey80\",\n    alpha = 0.3\n  ) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 0.7, alpha = 0.8) +\n  scale_colour_brewer(name = \"Age Group\", palette = \"Paired\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Unemployment Patterns by Age Group\",\n    subtitle = \"Unemployment rates for different age cohorts over time\",\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Unemployment Rate (%)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 13) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis multi-line plot shows unemployment by age group. Teenagers (16-19) and young adults (20-24) consistently have much higher unemployment—often 15-20% even in good times, partly due to part-time work and being laid off first. Prime-age workers (25-54) fare best, usually staying under 5% in normal times. Older workers (55+) are in the middle but face longer job searches when unemployed. During recessions, the young get hit hardest, unemployment can spike to 25% or more while prime-age workers might only reach 8-10%. They also seem to be more affected group during the pandemic.",

    "text": "4.1.1 Yield Curve Reliability\nThe yield curve remains one of the most consistent early warning indicators of recessions. Inversions in spreads such as the 10Y–2Y or the 10Y–3M regularly occur 6-15 months before economic downturns, and in many cases the signal appears well before unemployment begins to rise or inflation starts to fall. The 10Y–3M spread provides the earliest and most reliable signal, while the 10Y–2Y offers moderate predictive power. While false positives do occur (notably during the 1998 debt crisis), true positives dominate the historical record, strengthening the credibility of inversions as recession predictors.\n\n\n4.1.2 Inflation, Unemployment, and Recessions\nThe relationship between inflation and unemployment has shifted over time. During most recessions, we observe the classic trade-off: unemployment spikes while inflation drops. However, the 1970s-80s broke this pattern with stagflation which explains why the Phillips curve relationship failed then. Supply-driven inflation (energy prices) shows high volatility and temporary impacts on yields, while demand-driven inflation (core CPI) is smoother and has more persistent effects. The Fed can influence demand through policy but cannot control supply shocks, thus creating different policy challenges depending on the inflation source.\n\n\n4.1.3 Changing Nature of Recessions\nRecessions and unemployment no longer look the same.\nIn the mid-20th century, recessions caused sudden layoffs in manufacturing and construction, producing sharp spikes in unemployment. By contrast, more recent recessions, especially 2001 and 2020, show different patterns: slower climbs, service-sector contraction, and highly unequal effects across demographic groups. Women, younger workers, and Black and Hispanic workers often experience deeper and more prolonged unemployment during downturns, even when headline unemployment appears moderate. This emphasizes that the macroeconomic averages we usually monitor can hide important distributional realities.",

Recessions are not simply financial events or shifts in GDP. They are lived experiences that vary by time period, industry structure, and social group. Our findings suggest that while the yield curve tells us when trouble is coming, understanding how it will unfold requires looking beyond financial data and into the structure of the economy and the labor market itself.",
