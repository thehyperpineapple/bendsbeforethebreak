An analysis of U.S. Treasury yield curves, inflation, unemployment, and their relationships with economic recessions.

This project examines how yield curve inversions predict recessions, explores inflation dynamics (supply vs demand-driven), and analyzes unemployment patterns across demographic groups. The analysis uses data from FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) spanning 1954 to present.
